The ADC of this PIC is designed to be full scale with the supply voltage. 2.048V reference voltage is used as ADC. From that value, the voltage at full scale is obtained by backward calculation.

ADC the LED current.
Display it as a numerical value.

Determine the presence or absence of Laser.

If a laser is present, the temperature of the laser is displayed.

If there is no Laser: ADC the pressure sensor output.
Display it as a meter.
Display it numerically.
